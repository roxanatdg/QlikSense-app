# Business intelligence app in QlikSense

Business Intelligence app built in Qlik Sense, based on the dataset from AirBnB. The goal is to explore and visualize key patterns in Airbnb listings across major European cities using different data visualization techniques.

To enhance location-based analysis, I introduced a custom measure called CityCenterRange, which clusters listings based on their distance to the city center. This allows users to identify trends and pricing behaviors depending on how central the listing is.
